# PivApplet

## About

This is an attempt at making a PIV (NIST SP 800-73-4) compatible JavaCard
applet. Target is JavaCard 2.2.2+, with 1-3k of transient memory.

## Current status

What works:

 * OpenSC, MacOS (`piv.tokend` for login), Windows PIV
 * RSA-1024 and -2048 key generation on card, signing
 * EC P-256 and P-384 key generation
 * EC Diffie-Hellman on P-256 and P-384
 * ECDSA (only when using JavaCard 3.0.4+ builds)
    - JC 2.2.2 builds have a hash-on-card workaround (see below), but this is
      not standard PIV
 * PINs and change of PIN, PUK reset
 * Support for both 3DES and AES card administration keys
 * Most https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/Yubico_extensions.html[
   YubiKeyPIV-compatible extensions] are implemented and working:
    - PIN policy
    - Version indicator (we pretend to be a YK5)
    - Fetch serial number (randomly generated)
    - Set management key
    - Import asymmetric key
    - Reset after PIN+PUK blocked
    - Change PIN/PUK retry limits
    - Attestation using slot F9
    - Get metadata (5.3.0)

What doesn't work:

 * YubicoPIV touch policy
   - No standard JavaCard APIs for accessing GPIO or sensors so this is
     probably not happening.

## Installing

The pre-built `.cap` files for each release can be found on the
https://github.com/arekinath/pivapplet/releases[project release page].

You can use the
https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro[Global Platform] command-line
tool (`gp`) to upload the applet to your JavaCard:

-----
$ gp -install PivApplet.cap
CAP loaded
-----

Now you have a PIV card ready to initialise. It's easiest to do the
initialisation with the
https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/[`yubico-piv-tool`]:

-----
$ yubico-piv-tool -r '' -a list-readers
Alcor Micro AU9560 00 00
Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP+U2F+CCID 01 00

$ yubico-piv-tool -r Alcor -a generate -s 9e > pubkey-9e.pem
Successfully generated a new private key.

$ yubico-piv-tool -r Alcor -a selfsign-certificate -s 9e \
    -S '/CN=test' < pubkey-9e.pem > cert-9e.pem
Successfully generated a new self signed certificate.

$ yubico-piv-tool -r Alcor -a import-certificate -s 9e < cert-9e.pem
Successfully imported a new certificate.
-----

Now your PIV token is set up with a self-signed Card Authentication (`9e`)
key. You can generate keys and certificates in the other slots in a similar
fashion (remember that most other slots default to requiring a PIN entry,
which you have to do with `-a verify-pin -a selfsign-certificate ...` when
using `yubico-piv-tool`).

Sample output of `yubico-piv-tool -a status`:

## Default admin key & PINs

Default PIN:: `123456`
Default PUK:: `12345678`
Default card administration (`9B`) key:: `01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 ...`

(This is the default used by Yubikeys, so that the `yubico-piv-tool` will
work with PivApplet.)

Note that if 3DES admin key support is disabled, the default card
administration key will be AES-128 instead (with the first 16 bytes of the
default 3DES key as its value).

## ECDSA hash-on-card extension

When built for JavaCard 2.2.2, this applet supports an extension for doing ECDSA
with hash-on-card, which client software will have to specifically add support
for if it wants to use ECDSA signing. As of writing, the only PIV client with
support for this extension known to the authors is
https://github.com/arekinath/pivy[`pivy`].

Unfortunately, regular PIV ECDSA signing is not possible with the JavaCard
standard crypto functions in JC2.2.2 (it is possible in JC3.0.4 and later,
and builds of this applet for 3.0.4 use the standardised method), which only
support a single operation that combines hashing and signing. The current PIV
standard demands that the data to be signed is hashed by the host, and then the
hash is sent to the card.

In addition to the algorithm ID `0x11` for `ECCP256`, we introduce two new IDs,
`ECCP256-SHA1` (`0xF0`) and `ECCP256-SHA256` (`0xF1`). For key generation the
client should continue to use `ECCP256` (as well as for ECDH), but for signing
one of the two new algorithm IDs must be used (`ECCP256` will be rejected).

These two new algorithms are "hash-on-card" algorithms, where the "challenge"
tag sent by the host to the card should include the full data to be signed
without any hashing applied. The card will hash the data and return the
signature in the same was as a normal EC signature.

For example, to sign the payload `"foo\n"` with the Card Authentication (9e)
key, with SHA-256, the host could send the following APDU:

```
00 87 F1 9E 0A 7C 08 82 00 81 04 66 6F 6F 0A
```

This extension, naturally, will not work with existing PIV host software that is
not aware of it. It is supported as a workaround for users who are ok with
customising their host software who really want to use ECDSA.

Support for these new algorithms is advertised in the `0xAC` (supported
algorithms) tag in the response to `INS_SELECT`. Client software may detect
it there to decide whether to attempt use hash-on-card or not.

## Building the project

We use https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard[ant-javacard] for builds.

-----
$ git clone https://github.com/arekinath/PivApplet
...

$ cd PivApplet
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
...

$ export JC_HOME=/path/to/jckit-2.2.2
$ ant
-----

The capfile will be output in the `./bin` directory, along with the `.class`
files (which can be used with jCardSim).

You can also download pre-built capfiles from the
https://github.com/arekinath/PivApplet/releases[releases page] here on GitHub.

The applet can be configured to suit different cards or needs by adjusting
the feature flags in `build.xml` before running `ant`.

Currently available feature flags:

|===
|`PIV_SUPPORT_3DES`       | `D` | Enable support for 3DES admin keys
|`PIV_SUPPORT_AES`        | `a` | Enable support for AES admin keys
|`PIV_SUPPORT_RSA`        | `R` | Enable RSA support
|`PIV_SUPPORT_EC`         | `E` | Enable ECDSA and ECDH support
|`PIV_SUPPORT_ECCP384`    | `e` | Enable P-384 support with ECDSA/ECDH
|`PIV_USE_EC_PRECOMPHASH` | `P` | Use JC3.0.4+ API to allow standardised PIV ECDSA (rather than the hash-on-card extension, which will be disabled)
|`PIV_STRICT_CONTACTLESS` | `S` | Block most slots and keys from use over contactless (strictly conform to the PIV spec)
|`YKPIV_ATTESTATION`      | `A` | Enable YubicoPIV-style attestation slot and command
|`APPLET_EXTLEN`          | `x` | Support for extended APDUs. Some cards have bugs that make this feature malfunction (e.g. ACOSJ)
|`APPLET_LOW_TRANSIENT`   | `L` | Reduce required transient memory for the applet by shrinking buffers. Reduces maximum certificate size and may impact performance. Cannot be used with `YKPIV_ATTESTATION`.
|===

Tested card configurations:

|===
|NXP J3H145        | JC3.0.4      | `REePSAx`, `REePSAxaD`
|NXP J3D081        | JC2.2.2      | `RESAx`
|NXP J2A040        | JC2.2.2      | `RESAx`
|JC30M48CR         | JC3.0.4      | `ESPxL`, `RSxL`
|ACOSJ 40k D1      | JC3.0.4      | `REePSA`
|G&D StarSign CUT  | JC3.0.4      | `REePSAx`, `REePSAxaD`
|===

As of v0.8.0, the builds on the releases page are labelled with these same
abbreviations.

## Simulation

Simulator testing for this project has so far been done on Linux, using
jCardSim (both with and without a Virtual Smartcard Reader).

The easiest way to do it on Linux is with a virtual reader:

 1. Install `vsmartcard` (see
    http://frankmorgner.github.io/vsmartcard/virtualsmartcard/README.html[here],
    but it might also be in your distro's package manager). Once it's installed
    (and PCSCd restarted) your list of smartcard readers on the system (try
    `opensc-tool -l` or `yubico-piv-tool -a list-readers`) should include a
    bunch of `Virtual PCD` entries.
 2. Clone my fork of `jCardSim` (https://github.com/arekinath/jcardsim)
    and build it (using `mvn initialize && mvn clean install`)
 3. From the `pivapplet` directory (after running `ant` to build), run:
    `java -noverify -cp bin/:../jcardsim/target/jcardsim-3.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard test/jcardsim.cfg`

Now you should see a card appear in the first of the `Virtual PCD` readers. To
start the PivApplet up, send it a command like this:

```
$ opensc-tool -r 'Virtual PCD 00 00' -s '80 b8 00 00 12 0b a0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00 05 00 00 02 0F 0F 7f'
```

Then you should see the simulated PivApplet come to life! The forked jCardSim
currently spits out debug output on the console including full APDUs sent and
received, and stack traces of exceptions (very useful!).

You can also use the simulator with `jdb`, the Java debugger:

```
$ jdb -noverify -classpath bin/:../jcardsim/target/jcardsim-3.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard test/jcardsim.cfg
Initializing jdb ...
> stop at net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet:1769
Deferring breakpoint net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet:1769.
It will be set after the class is loaded.
> run
run com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard test/jcardsim.cfg
Set uncaught java.lang.Throwable
Set deferred uncaught java.lang.Throwable
